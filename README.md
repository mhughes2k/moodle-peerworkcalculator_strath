# Strathclyde Calculator

## Algorithm

## Historic "simple" model
The historic implementation of StrathPA, allowed for just 1 evaluation critera, so the "score" was simply taken as the "mean" of the scores awarded to a student by their peers.

Mod-peerwork allows for multiple, arbitrary criteria, so a more complex model that puts these together is necessary.

WebPA "simply" combines the values in the calculation, but we may not wish to.

We may elect to utilise the same algorithm but with an adjustment so that non-submission of reviews is handled so that the non-submitting user's score is not "improved" by this.

This simply could be to exclude them from the Web PA calculation.
